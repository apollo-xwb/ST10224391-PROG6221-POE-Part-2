Based on the feedback I received from my Part 1, I have made some changes as advised.
I've overalled the format by using various colour, headings and borders in order to enhance the visual appeal. 
I made sure that there was better error handling taking place throughout the app to guide users into 
a more seamless experience. Users are now notified whenever an error is made. The readme file is now 
far more comprehensible and includes instructions detailing how to install the project, which
 dependencies might be needed etc. I have also made sure to include some comments that follow 
internationallly accepted coding standards. As of now, the program will support unlimited recipes, 
will display the recipes in an alaphabetic manner, calculates calories and will alert the user if 
the calories of the meal exceed 300.
